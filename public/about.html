    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <hr>
    <article>
    <p>In 2004, I was born and raised in a small close called Ikuomola Close, where I spent most of my childhood indoors as I didn't enjoy socializing enough to make friends.<br>From a young age, I was curious and eager to learn, but I wasn’t the brightest and never excelled in school. When it came to hobbies, I participated in whatever was available, never truly choosing for myself. My early years were filled with intense memories of joy, love, sadness, loneliness, and more. However, I have managed to put all that behind me as I’ve grown as an individual.<br>These formative years laid the foundation for who I am today shaping my beliefs, goals, aspirations, and ultimately, who <strong><em>Afuye Hussein</em></strong> is.</p>

  Now, I have friends and have bonded more with my family. I am studying pharmacy at Afe Babalola University, entering my fourth year in a six-year course. I actively pursue my interests, try new things, and although I struggle with consistency, I keep an open mind. Recently, I decided to take my own life into my hands and find my way in life.
